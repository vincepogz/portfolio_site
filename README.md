# Heroku

> I wish I didnt try - Vince

## Background

Nearing the end of the bootcamp, I want to showcase all great projects I learned from NYC Tech Talent Program at John Jay College. I created a website that runs on Django Framework but the problem is it's impossible to host it in GitHub. This is where Heroku comes in.

## My Page
https://portfolio-ttp.herokuapp.com/

I started deploying this website since 2AM in the morning. I had no idea how Heroku works. Instead of giving up I did all the research I could just to run this simple page.

## The NAV

I was able to deploy my django project after 6 hours of Googling (YES ITS TRUE!). I'm really happy about this Navigation because it directs the viewer to the section they want to check out.

## My Projects

Not trying to brag but I did my work in this program. I'm finally able to talk about web-development when it comes to interviews.

## Django Admin

Of course, none of these will happen if I couldn't post my projects using the admin page.

## Note

I'm just tired and cant come up with sentences. But I want to thank the program for this opportunity!
